Subject: [LTSI-dev] [PATCH 3/4] LTSI: bugfix: sh73a0: add lost CLK_ENABLE_ON_INIT for DIV6_ZB1
To: ltsi-dev@lists.linuxfoundation.org
Cc: kuninori.morimoto.gx@gmail.com
Message-ID: <4FE998D6.9050209@kmckk.co.jp>


On upstream kernel, on one branch,
CLK_ENABLE_ON_INIT was added to DIV6_ZB1 clock by
9bcc0a5d0de137b3a154dc951c5ff70dce815879
(ARM: mach-shmobile: SH73A0 external Ethernet fix)

On the other branch, below commit modified dev6_clks[] controlling method.
d4775356bb39eaa305844cc6cc4c267236535956
(sh: clkfwk: clock-sh73a0: all div6_clks use SH_CLK_DIV6_EXT())

These 2 commit had conflict, and were solved when merge window
timing on upstream kernel.
But unfortunately, this solution seems had be lost on backporting.
This patch fixes it up for LTSI.
